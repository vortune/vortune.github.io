## Preparations
Before starting the process of installing Ubuntu, please read the [Ubuntu Installation Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/index.html) and take care to the important contents such as :

* [Preparing a USB stick using a hybrid CD or DVD image](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/ch04s03.html)
* [Pre-Partitioning for Multi-Boot Systems](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/ch03s05.html)
  * [Systems with UEFI firmware](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/ch03s06.html)

Download the [ISO image](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

### Making a USB boot stick using a ISO image
Copy the ISO image directly to the USB stick, shouldn't to its mount point. In here, the Linux host was assumed.

```shell
cp debian.ios /dev/sdX
sync
```
That is a little longer process. Where the 'X' in `/dev/sdX` is a storage devices identify that is generated by your Linux host.

> **IMPORTANT**: This process will destroy any existed data on USB stick, be careful to do data backup.

### Testing Compatibility

`UEFI: Generic Flash Disk 8.07` 

`Try Ubuntu without installing`

> Shutdown the laptop. After the Ubuntu on the USB stick has quited, It doesn't turnoff power directly, and in the QHD+ screen you may not read the notice massage. at that moment just press any key in order to turn off.

### Shrinking Space of Windows Partition

Usually, Windows 10 installer will fully uses space of disk that was remained by recovery and UEFI partitions. Run the below command to launch the **Windows Disk Manager** , you can use the search bar in *startup menu* to find and run it:

```shell
diskmgmt.msc
```

Once you open the Windows Disk Manager, right click the System Partition and select the 'shrink partition', re-plan the layout of partitions and leave enough free space for Linux.

> A recommended scheme for Windows partitions that has two partition which one for system and another for data. As the result of the layout, while you want to recovery Windows from any trouble, then only system partition will be formated. The space of Windows system partition recommend larger than 100 gigabyte.
